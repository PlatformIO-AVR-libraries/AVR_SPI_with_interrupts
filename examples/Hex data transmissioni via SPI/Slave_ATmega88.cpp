/**
 * @file Slave_ATmega88.cpp
 * @author Lukas Ternjej
 *
 * This is a simple example for receiving a hex data message via SPI.
 * This code is intended to be used on a slave device.
 * In this case, slave device is ATmega88, but is should not matter which device is used.
 * This library is compatible with all AVRxmega devices that have a dedicated SPI module.
 *
 * Default connection for SS pin is used, refer to ATmega88 datasheet (see ATmega88 pinout).
 * Slave device receives a hex command from master.
 * Depending on received command, led is turned on or off.
 *
 * LED with a series 220R resistor is connected from PORTC5 to GND.
